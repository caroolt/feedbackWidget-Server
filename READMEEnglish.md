### Project Description
###### description
This is the server of a project that was meant to be something "Simple", but that helps me to study reactJS, reactNative (I'm going to make the mobile version) and nodeJS - caring about accessibility. The project's goal is to be a widget where the user can send feedback, be it a bug, an improvement idea or any other feedback that doesn't fit in these other two categories, besides that, the user will have the option to insert a screenshot, but this one won't have to take a print, since by clicking the button the print is done automatically and applied in the feedback. When sending this feedback, it is entered into a database and emailed to the developers.
