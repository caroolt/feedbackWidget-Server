### Project Description
###### description
This is the server of a project that was meant to be something "Simple", but that helps me to study reactJS, reactNative (I'm going to make the mobile version) and nodeJS - caring about accessibility. The project's goal is to be a widget where the user can send feedback, be it a bug, an improvement idea or any other feedback that doesn't fit in these other two categories, besides that, the user will have the option to insert a screenshot, but this one won't have to take a print, since by clicking the button the print is done automatically and applied in the feedback. When sending this feedback, it is entered into a database and emailed to the developers.

### Techniques and Technologies
###### technologies
- Typescript
- Express
- SQLite (Ambiente DEV)
- Postgresql (Ambiente de produ√ß√£o)
- Prisma
- Jest

## üõ†Ô∏è Open and run the server
###### run_project
#### 1- Clone the Project
#### 2- Install all dependencies
   `npm install`
#### 3- Launch Prisma
   `npx prisma init`

#### 4- In the schema.prisma file copy and paste this:
```
   generator client {
      provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }

   datasource db {
    provider = "sqlite"
    url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }

   model Feedback {
      id String @id @default(uuid())

      type       String
      comment    String
      screenshot String?

      @@map("feedbacks")
   }
   ```
#### 5- Create the migrations in the dev or production environment with:
 ```
 //if it is a dev environment
 
 npx prisma migrate dev

 //if it is a production environment

 npx prisma migrate deploy
 ```
#### 6- Run the server 
   `npm run dev`

#### 7- Non-required step (if you want to see your database without having to install anything type this command in the console)
   `npx prisma studio`
